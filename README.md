First upload the code to your ESP32-CAM, when you power it on it will create its own AP.

Connect to the AP through a computer and open the RCcar.html file in your web browser.

You can control the car using W, A, S, D and the speed and angle of steering using the sliders.

Use Neopixels for the LEDS.


I know the code is very messy, if you would like further help feel free to contact me :D
